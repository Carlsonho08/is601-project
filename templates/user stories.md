# Initial set of user stories at the Initiative and Epic level.
## Background:
Our ongoing project involves the development of a comprehensive website for Rustic Italian Trattoria. To align our efforts and ensure clarity in our development goals, we need to document the initial set of user stories at the Initiative and Epic level.

## Objective:
Update the README file to include a section detailing the Initiative and Epic-level user stories for the "Website Development for Rustic Italian Trattoria" project.

## Proposed Changes:
Introduce a new section in the README file specifically for the Initiative - "Website Development for Rustic Italian Trattoria." Under this section, provide a list of user stories that outline the key objectives and features to be implemented.


## Initiative - Website Development for Rustic Italian Trattoria:
To ensure the success of Rustic Italian Trattoria's online presence and enhance the user experience, a comprehensive website development initiative will be undertaken. This initiative will focus on creating an immersive and visually appealing digital platform that effectively communicates the restaurant's ambiance, culinary offerings, and brand identity.
